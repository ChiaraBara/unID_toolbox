# unID_toolbox
Matlab toolbox for the estimation of the Information Decomposition terms in the univariate framework.
This toolbox allows for computing the information decomposition terms for a univariate process. Specifically, the measures of entropy, dynamic entropy, conditional entropy and information storage can be obtained by using the several estimation approaches, i.e., linear parametric, nearest neighbor, kernel, binning, permutation and slope.
